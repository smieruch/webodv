***ODV Release 5.1.0  (Windows, MacOS, Linux)  Aug/07/2018:


-- New flag Q in SEADATANET quality flag scheme.

-- New '?' operator in ODV macros and expressions allows conditional
   calculations based on availability of values for given input
   variables.

-- New "Best-of" P35 aggregation algorithm using only those
   contributing values with the best available quality. The previous
   "Use-all" algorithm using all available contributing values is
   still available. Also new is the creation of per-sample info
   strings containing the P01/P06 codes of contributing variables.

   The new "P35 Aggregation Properties" dialog allows algorithm
   selection and switching per-sample info creation on or off. This
   dialog always appears at the beginning of a P35 aggregation.

   P35 aggregation now only downloads the P35 vocabulary if a newer
   version is available on the NERC vocab server.

-- NetCDF exporter now uses 'byte' instead of 'char' for quality flag
   data, and sets the 'standard_name' attribute to 'status_flag'. Also
   supports the 'ancillary_variables' attribute. now also exports
   string data variables and info strings. now uses chunking and
   compression for all variables.

   WARNING: ODV-created netCDF files now require netCDF4 for reading.

-- New "String ID" derived variable, which for any TEXT or
   INDEXED_TEXT meta or data variable provides integer ID values for
   the different string values of the variable.

-- New "Sample Filter" submenu provides options "Accept All Data",
   "Reject Outliers" and "Customize Settings" (previously: "Sample
   Selection Criteria"). The first two options are automatic and easy
   to use. Option 3 provides the full control over all filter settings
   as in previous ODV versions.

-- New "Export>Station Data>SDN Harmonized ODV Collection" option
   for unit conversions and harmonization of SDN data collections.

-- Outlier list files created by "Tools > Find Outliers (Range Check)"
   now also include values of the primary variable.

-- Changed ODV file download URL to https.



BUG FIXES

-- Fixed inaccurate section distance calculations for very short
   sections.

-- Fixed crash when importing WHP exchange files containing empty
   lines after the END_DATA line.





***ODV Release 5.0.0  (Windows, MacOS, Linux)  Mar/19/2018:


-- New multi-view support via tabs and tool buttons.

-- Sections can now have Time as along-section coordinate in addition
   to distance, longitude and latitude.

-- More efficient importers (SeaDataNet importer is now about 8 times
   faster).

-- Many other enhancements



BUG FIXES

-- Many fixes.






***ODV4 Release 4.7.10  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Feb/07/2017:


BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem not loading last view when starting ODV (bug
   introduced in 4.7.9).
   





***ODV4 Release 4.7.9  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Jan/12/2017:
   

-- Derived variables "Data Error Value" and "Quality Flag Value" moved
   from group "Metadata" to "Special".

-- New "Tools > Other Collection > Compare Data Availability" option
   allows data availability comparison between the currently open and
   another, user-selected data collection.

-- New "Tools > Other Collection > Inherit View File(s)" option allows
   one or more user-selected view files from another collection to be
   inherited into the current collection.

-- View files for full-screen map and for overview displays of all
   data are now automatically created when a new collection is
   created. 

-- String data variables of value type INDEXED_TEXT can now be used
   for sample range filtering. This was already possible for numeric
   variables and variables of type TEXT.

-- The number of decimal places for numerical variables written by the
   "WHP Exchange File > Bottle" exporter now is the number of decimal
   places of the variable plus 3. This is the same behavior as with
   the ODV Spreadsheet exporter.

-- The exports of window X, Y, Z data via "Extras > Clipboard Copy"
   and "Export > X, Y, Z Window Data" now write more decimal places
   (decimal places of the variable + 3).

-- The "Tools > 3D Estimation" option can now be used with collections
   that have pressure data but not depth.
   
-- The new command "set_axis_full_ranges" is now available in ODV cmd
   command files. The "load_view" and "open_collection" commands now
   support specification of template views, such as "$FullScreenMap$".

-- Existing station filters in the map are now maintained when loading
   layout templates.
   


BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem with "CO3--" derived variable not being remembered in
   view files.

-- Fixed problem with range sample filter. Previously if the value of
   a range-filtering variable was missing the sample was accepted. Now
   the sample is rejected. Only samples that have values within the
   acceptable range are accepted.

-- Fixed problem with calculation of fractional "day-of-year",
   "day-of-month", and "day-of-week" derived variables and axis
   annotations, when used in data windows.

-- Fixed bug when trying "Tools > 3D Estimation" with derived
   variables. 

-- Fixed bug when exporting to ODV Spreadsheet date/time data in
   "minutes since ..." and "seconds since ..." units.

-- Fixed occasional crashes when trying to open netCDF files a second
   time.






***ODV4 Release 4.7.8  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Aug/29/2016:
   

-- When exporting as collection, ODV now automatically also exports
   local file references, including cruise report files, comment files
   and info files.

-- The Current Sample list window now has a search box for finding
   particular variables quickly.



BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem with wrong annotations on time axis.

-- Fixed crashes occuring during "Tools > 3D Estimation" when
   requesting estimates for depth values beyond the data range.

-- Problem with case sensitivity of variable names in SDN .txt files
   fixed. 







***ODV4 Release 4.7.7  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Jul/12/2016:
   

-- The SeaDataNet importer now only lumps together variables with the
   same column labels if P01/P06 codes also agree. If column labels
   agree but codes differ a unique column label is generated by
   appending a '_n' suffix, where n is a suitable integer, and a
   separate variable with the modified column label is created.

-- Station selection criteria "Date / Time > Period" now allows
   specifying "From" and "To" day-time.

-- PNG and TIF output images can now have a transparent background.



BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem in Sea-Bird cnv file importer. Comments are now
   successfully extracted.

-- Fixed problem with "Difference from Reference" derived variables.

-- Fixed problem with longitude and latitude values provided as degrees,
   minutes, and seconds (e.g., "32 18 23.1 N" or "32°18'23.1''N") in
   spreadsheet import files not being handled properly and not being
   imported.

-- Fixed problem of misplaced color bar in eps graphics export.

-- Existing view files are now preserved if converting a ODVCF5
   collection to ODVCF6.









***ODV4 Release 4.7.6  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Mar/23/2016:
   


BUG FIXES

-- Fixed station selection problem when using "Date/Time > Period".






***ODV4 Release 4.7.5  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Mar/15/2016:


-- New importer for GOSUD underway data.

-- Collections created during Sea-Bird .cnv import now have the "Cast
   Type" meta variable. This allows station filtering by up- and
   down-cast.

-- ODV strings may now contain '&#<code>;' html control sequences for
   producing Unicode characters. '&#x00A9;', for instance, will
   produce the copyright symbol.

-- The ODV Spreadsheet, ODV Collection and netCDF data exporters now
   allow subsetting the list of extended meta variables to be
   exported. The ODV Collection exporter now allows enabling/disabling
   station history export and copying of linked document files.

-- The station history exporter now allows filtering the history
   records to be exported.

-- Calculation of isosurface variables now detects and uses samples on
   the surface. No interpolation is performed in these cases.
   
-- Physical properties based on the outdated EOS80 are now available
   as derived variables to allow comparative studies. Normally the
   derived variables based on TEOS-10 should be used.

-- Color bars can now be placed at the bottom or right of data
   plots. The spacing between colorbar labels can now be set by the
   user via "Properties > Data > Colorbar Settings > Label interval".

-- The "unit-sized-dot" info box that appears when drawing data as
   "Sized Dots" can now be dragged around and the new position is
   remembered in the view.

-- Removed the Print and Print Preview options. As alternative, please
   save the canvas or individual plot windows as image or PostScript
   files and then print the images or PostScript file.
   


BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem when importing cnv files containing multiple lines
   for the same metadata item and the last such line is without value.

-- Problems with shortcut keys, such as Ctrl+F and Alt-P fixed.

-- Fixed problem with the "Tools > Infix-to-Postfix Converter" option.







***ODV4 Release 4.7.4  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Oct/05/2015:


-- The new keywords 'minimum' and 'maximum' can now be used for
   specifying minimum (maximum) layers as isosurfaces in isosurface
   variables. Examples: "Depth @ Oxygen=minimum", "Oxygen @
   Oxygen=minimum", "Phosphate @ Oxygen=minimum". See chapter 7 in the
   User's Guide for more information.

-- The Sea-Bird cnv importer now supports multi-cast files. Multi-cast
   cnv files must contain one cast description line for every cast in
   the file. Cast description lines must be of the following form:
   
   "* cast   4 07 Jul 2015 09:00:29 samples 6415 to 7768, avg = 1, stop = mag switch"
  
   where the samples entry specifies the first and last data line
   index of the respective cast.

-- In addition to numeric data, ODV now also shows values of NC_CHAR
   text variables from netCDF files opened with "File > Open" or "File
   > Open Remote".

   NOTE: Views created for netCDF files using ODV 4.7.3 and before may
   not display properly with ODV 4.7.4 and later due to the
   differences in the number and order of variables introduced with
   ODV 4.7.4. If you encounter problems please re-define isosurface
   variables and re-assign variables on the X, Y, and Z axis of your
   data windows.

-- Import history records now include MD5 checksums and file sizes in
   addition to last-modified dates of the import files.

-- It is now possible to create interrupted maps with the original
   data points as colored dots.

-- In FixedWidth animations you can now specify separate values for
   step and interval width.

-- ODV command files now support local variables via the new "set_var"
   command.
   
-- This version automatically moves the ODV settings file from the ODV
   user directory to the user's home directory. 

-- The ODV user directory can now be moved to a different location via
   "View > Settings > System > User Directory".
   


BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem when deleting stations in very large collections with
   metadata file sizes exceeding 2GB.

-- Fixed a problem when calculating "Derivative" derived variables.

-- Fixed a P35 aggregation problem when quality flag values were
   changed but the original flag value should have been kept.






***ODV4 Release 4.7.3  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  July/02/2015:


-- The Argo profile and trajectory importers now provide large numbers
   of additional metadata and data variables. In particular, the
   bio-optical and bio-geochemical variables in bioArgo files are now
   imported. The delayed mode version of the data (suffix "adjusted")
   now use the values of _ADJUSTED_ERROR variables as 1-sigma error
   values. Original values are provided in trajectory import files and
   data averaging is no longer performed. The new Argo importers
   require v3.1 netCDF files. Previous formats are rejected.

-- The SDN netCDF importer now properly reads string variables of
   arbitrary length (required length 80 before). The "sdn:scope="
   entry in xlink references in .txt files is now used for assignment
   to the respective LOCAL_CDI_ID. The "Instrument Info" value and the
   variable names in the Current Sample window are now clickable, and
   users will see the descriptions of the respective codes.

-- The MEDATLAS profile importer now uses depth (DEPH) data if
   pressure (PRES) is not provided. The depth data are automatically
   converted to pressure and used in the pressure variable.

-- The Sea-Bird cnv importer now extracts the additional "Operator"
   and "Ship" metadata.

-- The "Save as Interrupted Map" option now also draws the graphics
   objects of the parent window.

-- Refined interpolation methods provide better isosurface variable
   values near the ends of the observed ranges.

-- "Tools > Ocean Calculator > Settings" now lets user choose between
   practical and absolute salinity as input to many variables.




BUG FIXES

-- Fixed crashes when using "Extras > Statistics" (F4) on data windows
   with reversed ranges.







***ODV4 Release 4.7.2  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  April/20/2015:


-- Data windows with longitude and latitude basic data variables on X
   and Y are now treated as geographic maps. This was already the case
   for derived longitude and latitude variables on X and Y.




BUG FIXES

-- Fixed problem with "readme.txt" files in SeaDataNet imports.

-- Data errors now properly loaded and displayed for variables using
   separate error variables holding the 1 sigma data errors.

-- Problem with editing Aggregated derived variables fixed. Deleting
   contributors did not work.





***ODV4 Release 4.7.1  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Mar/19/2015:


-- The ODV dummy palette is now the same as the new Odv.pal.






***ODV4 Release 4.7.0  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Mar/18/2015:


-- New interrupted map plot type for station and isosurface
   maps. Available via context menu "Save As Interrupted Map" option.

-- New map contour resources based on the GEBCO 2014 grid replaces the
   GEBCO08 packages. Use "View > Settings > Map > Resources" ("odv4 >
   Preferences" on Mac OS X) for installation.

-- New global or regional gridded bathymetry resources for use as
   section bottom bathymetry or in DIVA domain setup. Use "View >
   Settings > Gridded Bathymetry > Resources" ("odv4 > Preferences" on
   Mac OS X) for installation.

-- Improved placement of contourline labels avoiding cluttering.

-- The ODV spreadsheet importer now supports latitude and longitude
   values as degrees, minutes, and seconds (seconds are optional) as
   long as they appear in single columns. Supported formats include:
   "32° 18' 23.1'' N", "32°18'23.1''N" or "32 18.756 N". You must use
   "Latitude [deg min]" and "Longitude [deg min]" as column headers.

-- Lines, polylines and polygons can now have special symbols such as
   arrow heads, filled or open dots and bars at their start and/or end
   points. You select such symbols and specify their size via the
   property dialog of the object.

-- New "1 SURFACE + 1 SCATTER Windows" layout template.

-- The P35 aggregation option now uses the data agreement file of the
   source collection (if any) for the target collection.

-- The name of SDN usage agreement file must now be "readme.txt".

-- The "Integral" derived variable now uses a more refined method for
   calculating the value at integration start. In many cases this
   produces results when the previous method failed.

-- New Odv.pal color palette. The previous color palette is available
   as "Odv_465.pal".



BUG FIXES

-- Fixed errors when calculating isosurface values on surface
   variables with very small relative range. 

-- Fixed issues with animations of arrow fields.

-- Fixed issue with "==" operator in macros and expressions.

   again.





***ODV4 Release 4.6.5  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Dec/11/2014:


-- New "Collection > Package" option allows packaging a collection in
   a zip file for backup or exchange.

-- File open and save dialogs now use sidebar folders as in ODV 4.6.2
   and before.

-- The SDN importer now extracts the contents of the "read_me.txt"
   file (if any) and uses this text for usage agreement dialogs of all
   created collections.

-- Recognizes more SDN biology parameters.



BUG FIXES

-- Map frame issues for south- and north polar projections fixed.

-- Fixed crash when opening netCDF files with "Dummy" primary
   variable. 







***ODV4 Release 4.6.4.1  (Mac OS X)  Nov/24/2014:

BUG FIXES

-- Double-clicking on odv or var files in the Finder now opens the
   collection in ODV.






***ODV4 Release 4.6.4  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Nov/18/2014:

-- "Import > SDN Formats" option now supports SDN netCDF files in
   addition to SDN ODV spreadsheet files. Both file formats can be
   combined in a single import.

-- For option "Export > Station Data > SDN Aggregated ODV Collection"
   ODV now downloads the latest unit conversion list from the ODV site
   and the latest P35 vocab from the BODC site. If not connected to
   the Internet ODV uses the most recent files available on the
   system. Initial files are delivered during ODV installation.

-- Variable "MinimumObservationDepth" (SDN:P01::MINDPCDI) in SDN data
   files is now recognized as vertical coordinate and primary
   variable.

-- NetCDF files created via "Export > Station Data > NetCDF File" now
   also contain data error values for variables containing data
   errors.

-- When opening netCDF files ODV now interpretes variables with names
   of the form "nnn_STD" or "nnn_std" as data error variable for
   parent variable "nnn".

-- ARGO v3.1 profile and trajectory netCDF files are now supported by
   "Import > ARGO Formats > ..." options.

-- Transition to Qt 5. ODV 4.6.4 and later now use Qt 5 libraries on
   all supported platforms (64 and 32 bit versions).

 

BUG FIXES

-- Fixed crash when editing text data values.






***ODV4 Release 4.6.3.1  (Windows 64bit)  Aug/29/2014:

-- "//<MetaVariable>" lines in ODV spreadsheet files may now also
   contain the "var_type" tag to specify meta variables with special
   meaning and treatment.

 

BUG FIXES

-- Fixed GOB-file import with Mac EOL characters.

-- Fixed occasional problems setting TEXT values when importing or
   editing data.

-- Fixed user- and hostname bug on Windows 64 bit.





***ODV4 Release 4.6.3  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Aug/19/2014:

-- New 64-bit ODV versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is
   recommended to use the 64-bit ODV versions on 64-bit operating
   systems. The 64-bit versions can be installed next to an already
   installed 32-bit ODV. Both versions remain functional.

-- High-resolution (retina) display support implemented (Mac OS X
   64bit version only).

-- New option "Export > Station Data > SDN Aggregated ODV Collection"
   providing P35 variable aggregation for SDN collections.

-- Collections created via "Import > SDN Spreadsheet" now contain many
   more meta variables. References in "//<sdn_reference" lines are
   extracted and instrument codes in semantic header "instrument" tags
   are collected and stored in the new meta variable "Instrument Info".

-- New derived variable "Metadata > Data Error Value" providing
   1-sigma data errors (if available) as a separate variable.

-- New "//<MetaVariable>" and "//<DataVariable>" structured comment
   lines in ODV Spreadsheet files allow detailed property
   specifications for meta and data variables.

-- When exporting data to a netCDF file via "Export > Station Data >
   NetCDF File" a summary table containing nc variable names and
   associated ODV variable labels, units and comments is created in
   the new nc_variables.txt file.

-- New searchbox on some selection dialogs facilitates finding
   specific entries when working with long lists.

-- When calculating geostrophic flows via "Tools > Geostrophic Flows"
   the user may now modifiy the required station distance and distance
   from the Equator. Station pairs with smaller distances from each
   other or from the Equator are excluded from the calculations. 
 

BUG FIXES

-- Fixed SDN importer bug for files that have SDN:P06::UUUU
   (dimensionless) as units code of the first data variable (the one
   following "Bot. Depth [m]").

-- Fixed spreadsheet importer problem with files without
   latitude/longitude or date information.

-- Fixed rare crashes when calculating geostrophic velocities.





***ODV4 Release 4.6.2  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Mar/31/2014:


-- Efficiency of SeaDataNet and Spreadsheet importers improved
   significantly. Performance of these importers now is comparable to
   or better than in version 4.5.7.

-- Spreadsheet file importer now uses the first QV column for a given
   variable in cases of multiple such columns.

-- Updated atmospheric gas history files (thanks to J. Bullister).

 
BUG FIXES

-- Fixed "mixup" of extra meta variables when using "Export > Station
   Data > ODV Collection", or "Collection > Properties > Convert to
   ODVCF6" on ODVCF5 collections.

-- Fixed rare box-averaging bug for stations with very many samples.






***ODV4 Release 4.6.1  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Feb/18/2014:


-- New "Export > Station History" option writing the history records
   of the currently selected stations to a file (ODVCF6 collections
   only).

-- Procedure for defining Aggregated and Converted derived variables
   simplified.

-- Data export to collection now also exports derived variable data.






***ODV4 Release 4.6.0  (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)  Jan/29/2014:


-- New ODVCF6 collection format providing the following new features:

   1. New Accession Number metadata variable providing a unique and
      non-modifiable identification number for every station in a
      collection. The Accession Number of a station is preserved
      during Sort and Condense operations, while the Station IDs
      normally change because of changes in the order of stations in
      the collection.

   2. New value types for metadata and data variables: SIGNED_BYTE,
      UNSIGNED_SHORT, UNSIGNED_INTEGER, INDEXED_TEXT. INDEXED_TEXT
      supports UNICODE strings of arbitrary lengths. Strings occurring
      many times (e.g., cruise labels) are handled very efficiently.

   3. Data variables can now have numerical 1-sigma error values as
      well as info texts. Info texts can be literal, or links to info
      files provided with the collection or URLs to external
      webpages. Error and info values are optional. The ODV
      spreadsheet format is extended and now allows error and info
      columns.

   4. Per-station history records. All import and data edit actions
      are remembered in the history of the given station. History
      information is maintained when exporting data to collection or
      ODV spreadsheet file.

   5. Proper ReadWrite or ReadOnly access management. ReadWrite access
      to a collection is only granted if the application is the only
      one currently working with the collection. A second application
      opening the same collection will only have ReadOnly access. Once
      a collection is open in more than one application, the access
      mode of the first application is dynamically reduced to
      ReadOnly. An original ReadWrite access is dynamically restored
      when all other applications using the collection have
      terminated.

   6. Collection password protection. ODVCF6 collections can now be
      password protected to prevent unauthorized use.


APPLICATION WINDOW

-- New collection access status (RW, R, R-) pane in the status bar.

-- Separate context menus when right-clicking into the Current Sample
   Window": (1) variable label click, (2) data and quality value
   click, (3) info column click.


IMPORTER

-- The ODV Spreadsheet importer now also evaluates the LOCAL_CDI_ID
   metavalue (if provided in the spreadsheet file) for detecting
   station breaks.

-- The SeaDataNet Importer now also extracts and imports .zip files
   contained inside .zip files (1 extra level). The value in
   //<SDN_REFERENCES> comment lines is now extracted and provided in
   the new "Reference" meta variable. LOCAL_CDI_ID, EDMO_code and URL
   metadata entries are clickable, thereby opening documents with more
   in-depth information in the web-browser.

-- The WOD importer now extracts values for two new meta variables:
   "OCL Cruise Number" and "Investigator". Investigator codes from the
   WOD files are resolved using the US NODC primary investigator
   list. ODV shows the resolved investigator names.

-- The Sea-Bird Importer now extracts all header lines from the top of
   the imported .cnv files and makes this information available in
   automatically created per-station comment files that are part of
   the collection. A new "Comments" meta variable holds the name of
   the corresponding comments file. Clicking on the file name will
   show the contents of the comments file in your web-browser.  The
   .cnv header often contains important information, such as sensor
   identification and calibration data.


 
BUG FIXES

   that this option is only enabled if neutral density gamma-n or a
   potential density derived variable is defined and DIVA gridding is
   used.

-- DIVA gridding now uses variable-resolution rectangular
   grids. Direction constraint feature is removed (use "Isopycnic
   gridding" instead).

-- DIVA optimizations lead to about 25% speed improvements (thanks to
   J.-M. Beckers, Univ. Liege, Belgium).

   definitions from a view file in addition to manual setup. The view
   file must belong to the currently open collection.


IMPORTER

-- Woce bottle or CTD data can now be imported by simply dropping the
   files on the ODV window.

-- The WOCE bottle importer now incorporates cruise reports found
   during import in the data collection and provides a clickable meta
   variable cruise report link. Comments at the top of WOCE exchange
   files are extracted and viewable by clicking the "Comments"
   meta-variable value.

-- ODV Spreadsheet, ARGO, GTSPP, Medatlas and WOD imports can now be
   initiated without an open collection. In such cases a suitable
   target collection is created automatically and the data are
   imported into the newly created collection.

-- The SeaDataNet importer now accepts new SDN/ODV files with "P01"
   and "P06" vocabulary names. Old files using "P011" and "P061" are
   still supported.

-- ODV now handles netCDF files containing variables with zero
   dimensions.

   identification in the log file and outlier list files.

-- The Undo facility has been improved and a Redo option has been
   added.


TOOLS

-- The Ocean Calculator (invoked via Tools>Ocean Calculator) now
   allows specification of vectors of input variable values as
   "start:increment:end" triples for one or more input
   variables. Results are calculated for all requested inputs and

   up/down cast splitting and subsampling should occur. Now also tries
   to extract bottom depth information from suitable user metadata
   entry (e.g. "** Bottom Depth [m]: 123"). Fixed issues with files
   containing more than one column with identical names and issues
   with date/time extraction from user-metadata (e.g. "** UTC (Time):
   May 10 2009 04:58:21").

-- Woce CTD and Bottle imports can now be initiated with no collection
   open. In these cases the superset of variables contained in the
   import files is determined and a suitable receiving collection is
   created automatically.

-- Woce Bottle collections now have CTDPRS [DBAR] instead of DEPTH [M]
