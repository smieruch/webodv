This directory contains hydrographic and nutrient data from the South
Atlantic Ventilation Experiment (SAVE, ODF Reports 224-228) for Ocean
Data View 4.0.

After successful installation of the Ocean Data View 4.0 software you
run ODV on the SAVE data by double-clicking on the SAVE.var file. You
invoke ODV's functionality through the main menu (just below the ODV
title-bar) or via popup menus that you activate by clicking the right
mouse button. Note that you get different popup menus depending on the
mouse position at the time of the click.  You select stations or
samples by simply clicking on them with the left mouse button.

Note that you can change and store the ODV screen layout and
configuration easily. Some example configuration files are included in
the ODV distribution.  You invoke a particular configuration file by
using the main menu option "Configuration->Load Configuration". You
store a particular configuration by choosing "Configuration->Save
Configuration As" and specifying a configuration name.

For further information visit the ODV help file that can be invoked via
ODV's Help Topic option or by pressing F1.
